# Sliding Window Pattern

Things I learned:
- Always start with brute force
- Window size fixed vs variable matters
- Keep invariants like sum / distinct count
- Frequency array helps avoid recomputation

Common mistakes I made:
- Off by one errors
- Out of bounds access
- Recomputing sum instead of sliding it
  ## AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING i've LEARNED.
You must write the brute-force approach first and then optimize it by
analyzing its flaws.

If you try to directly write an O(N) solution, it will take you forever
to truly understand DSA.
